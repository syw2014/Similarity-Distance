# Similarity-Distance
Description:
	This repository is mainly about various distances as similarity used in machine learning ,data mining.

	There are twelve distances to descript a similarity or distance in machine learning and data mining,there are :
	
	1) Distance between numberical data
		- 1. Minkowski distance

		- 2. Euclidean distance

		- 3. Manhattan distance

		- 4. Mahalanobis distance
	
	2) Inner product
		- 5. Cosine similarity

		- 6. Pearson correlation

	3) Distance between classified data
		- 7. Hamming distance
	
		- 8. Jaccard similarity

	4) Distance between sequences
		- 9. Levenshtein distance/Edit distance

		- 10. Dynamic time warp

	5) Distance in probability distribution
		- 11. Chi-Square

		- 12. KL-Divergence/Relative entropy
